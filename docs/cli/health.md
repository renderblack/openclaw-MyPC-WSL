# health

# `openclaw health`

Fetch health from the running Gateway.

Options:

* `--json`: machine-readable output
* `--timeout <ms>`: connection timeout in milliseconds (default `10000`)
* `--verbose`: verbose logging
* `--debug`: alias for `--verbose`

Examples:

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"min-light","dark":"min-dark"}}
openclaw health
openclaw health --json
openclaw health --timeout 2500
openclaw health --verbose
openclaw health --debug
```

Notes:

* Default `openclaw health` asks the running gateway for its health snapshot. When the
  gateway already has a fresh cached snapshot, it can return that cached payload and
  refresh in the background.
* `--verbose` forces a live probe, prints gateway connection details, and expands the
  human-readable output across all configured accounts and agents.
* Output includes per-agent session stores when multiple agents are configured.
