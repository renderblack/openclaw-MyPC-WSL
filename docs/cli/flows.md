# flows (redirect)

# `openclaw tasks flow`

Flow commands are subcommands of `openclaw tasks`, not a standalone `flows` command.

```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"min-light","dark":"min-dark"}}
openclaw tasks flow list [--json]
openclaw tasks flow show <lookup>
openclaw tasks flow cancel <lookup>
```

For full documentation see [Task Flow](/automation/taskflow) and the [tasks CLI reference](/cli/index#tasks).
